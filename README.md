# Overview

This project acts as an introduction to object-oriented programming in C# with an emphasis on file manipulation and asynchronous functioning.

Notekeeper is a console application for creating, viewing, and editing notes.

I created this application for quick jot-down notes. I run a tabletop game, and it's useful to have somewhere to write things down that I can see them later.

# Development Environment

I used several console menuing packages during the construction of this application, but none of them seemed to quite serve the purpose I need; they were all either quite barren, or a little too inflexible when it came to leaving and reentering their menu flows. Eventually, I stripped them away and made a very basic C# menu class myself. I'm interested in expanding on it in the future, perhaps even making my own console menuing package.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to make a separate place to store notes, rather than relying on local folders. I'd like to be able to search and sort, too.
- I want to improve my menuing with more robust options, including an in-app note deletion function.
- I want to clean up the menu 'front-end' with more aesthetic and performant navigation.
